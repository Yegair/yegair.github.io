                        taught me the importance of optimizing pages for loading speed. At that time I also had my first

                        another look. In fact, for many years, I was actively advocating against the use of JavaScript
                        in web pages, except for purely cosmetic purposes.

                        I stuck to this technology stack until I got into University, where I was first introduced to

                        always evaluated technologies by whether I was able to use them for one of my web projects. At
                        the time I couldn{"'"}t afford to spend money on servers for running a JVM, and web-space with
                        PHP/MySQL was essentially free. However, it took a few days of learning Java until I realized,
                        how much a statically typed language can help maintaining a large codebase. I really wanted to
                        not just learn it, but actually use it, so after one week of going to university, I applied for

                        was a great time, and sometimes I really miss the way I used to work there. Not only did I have
                        all the freedom I needed, but I also learned a lot about applied IT-Security, how to write
                        scientific texts, and met a great number of highly talented people.

                        Then came one of these days that turned my professional life upside-down. I was talking to a
                        good friend of mine I knew from my time at CoSee, and he asked me, whether I would like to found
                        a company and get into freelancing. At first I denied, because I had just started working at
                        eXXcellent, and I really liked it so far. However, after thinking about it for a while I agreed.
                        The main reason was, that I always dreamt about having my own company, being my own boss and
                        making my own decisions. Although I always imagined having a company which creates and sells a
                        great product, getting into freelancing seemed like a good first step into the right direction.
                        And of course you can just earn so much more money as a freelancer. To this day I am still
                        unsure if german software developers are generally underpaid, or if freelancers are way
                        overpaid, because of the large gap between the two. In my case my income increased by 450% over
                        night, for doing nearly exactly the same work. So, we founded CodingGene.

                        6 months later the project failed completely. I think mainly because creating everything from
                        scratch just took too much time, but I never got to know the exact reason for the cancellation.
                        In any case it opened my eyes regarding something, that every developer thinks or says at least
                        once in their career:{' '}

                        When it comes to modernizing large software systems, you should find a way to do it in small

                        That is what we did the next 6 months. We took the old customer portal and injected small pieces
                        of new technology, focusing on improving the user experience as well as the developer
                        experience, without breaking any existing functionality. It worked so well, that we were able to
                        complete several small projects in time with ease, which happened at this company very rarely.
                        After one exciting year I left the project with the great feeling, that I had made an impact on
                        where they were headed in the future.

                        I already had my next project and client waiting, with lots of work to be done. It was a company
                        based in Australia, which had just opened an office in Germany. At the time they had outsourced
                        most of their software development, but that no longer worked for them. They wanted to
                        transition to in-house development teams, but due to the lack of enough qualified candidates for
                        employment, they needed some external help to get started.

                        in-house developers really wanted to take responsibility, and not only be a replacement for the
                        old external software development company. It was more than a pleasure to help them achieve

                        After working for this company for about half a year, I was assigned to a very urgent project.
                        One of their existing systems for B2B sales needed a modification and extension at its very
                        core. Due to performance reasons (I was told) most of the critical business logic was
                        implemented in SQL, with{' '}

                        being the RDBMS. It was very challenging. We got it done in time and there were no major
                        catastrophes despite the fact, that we made an open-heart surgery on a system we had never
                        worked with up to this point. However, I quickly noticed what a poor choice MySQL was for this
                        system. Whenever I searched for a good solution to a weird SQL problem, I found a great solution
                        for PostgreSQL and a poor/hacky solution for MySQL. I accepted it, because there was nothing I
                        could do about it, but since that time, I am convinced, that PostgreSQL almost always is the
                        better choice when it comes to selecting an RDBMS.

                        small projects for other clients, but they were mostly about consulting and giving advice rather
                        than writing software.
